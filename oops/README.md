## Why OOPs with Go
- Go is not OOP language but post-OOP language. Which means we can leverage the object oriented principles to write more structured and understandable code with Go.
## Principles and Patterns

(Encapsulation, Composition, Polymorphism and Inheritance)

1. Binding methods to a type.
2. Composition through embedding. 
3. Use of Constructur on a type.
4. Polymorphism - property of having many/multiple forms.
    - Polymorphism in Go the right way - Interfaces.
5. No Inheritance (HAS-A instead of IS-A; Composition over inheritance)
6. Dependency Injection - No constructor should call another constructor.
